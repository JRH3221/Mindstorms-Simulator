# Mindstorms-Simulator
Program for simulating various Mindostorms robots in different scenarios.

## What is the project for?
The Mindstorms Simulator is usefull for a slew of different scenarios, but the main being competition robots. Sometimes a builder can't get hands on with their robot hence the need for a simulator. Also quick testing and rapid code itteration is supported with the simulator. So instead of loading code onto, and physically running the robot, a builder can just run the same code within the simulator.

## Downloading & Contributing
To download a version of the software, go to packages and downlaod the latest. To contribute, fork the repo with your own branch, make sure the name exaplains the addition/change. After you've finished, created a pull request to merge your branch with 'main'. The merge will go through a review process and will either be merged or rejected. Once in main, it may take a while for the update to be in a package, as the whole application needs to go through various tests and meet certain version goals.

## Documentation
Documentation can be found in the Docs folder, it contains different .MD and .html files that will help with things like testing, building, usage and code.
